# Dictionary in Python
# A dictionary in Python is a built-in data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. 
# It is unordered, mutable, and allows for fast lookup of values based on keys.

# Key Features of Dictionaries
# Key-Value Pairs → Data is stored as {key: value} pairs.
# Unordered (Before Python 3.7) → No fixed order (but from Python 3.7+, dictionaries maintain insertion order).
# Mutable → Values can be changed, added, or removed.
# Keys Must Be Unique → Duplicate keys are not allowed.
# Keys Must Be Immutable → Keys can be str, int, tuple, etc., but not lists or dictionaries.
